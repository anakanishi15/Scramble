\f0\fs24 \cf0 Record of thinking 2\
\
This week, I finished up my programme. Or, I finished up the main details. Before today, I was worried about whether or not I would be able to read text into the programme off a separate document. However, I got Ms. Nagoshi to help me figure out how to solve it, since she mentioned earlier that she knew how to do that. Additionally, Bri gave me some ideas on how to implement that read-in part through her own programme. So collaboration is really helpful, and I'm not sure how much I really thought about that. Admittedly, I thought that I would have spent more time on my project than I actually did, but at the same time, I think I did spend more time than I thought on other parts of the project. So I guess it all balances out. }
