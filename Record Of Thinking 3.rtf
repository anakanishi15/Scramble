\f0\fs24 \cf0 Record of Thinking 3\
I spent this week finishing up little details with my programme, making it work better and more user friendly. The part that surprised me the most was the little things that kept popping into my head, little suggestions that could potentially be good to add, but might not be necessary or even useful. At the beginning of the assignment, I just added them as quickly as I thought of them, but as the project neared the midpoint and conclusion, I find myself considering if I actually need them (as previous additions have been since quickly deleted). Another thing that I find interesting about this is that it is a rather specialized project. Not many people would use it except for me. However, this is supposed to be easily used by other people, so I have to take them into consideration as I design the project. I also realized that I had, at some point, broken part of my code without realizing it, so I not have to fix part of it. The reason that it is a problem is because I added a lot of code at once without deleting it, which is unfortunate. I think I'm still roughly at the same point, percentage-wise.}
